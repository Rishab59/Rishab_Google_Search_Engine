# Rishab_Google_Search_Engine
* This code takes the input from the user and searches the result in original google search engine.
* I have given a mic symbol just to maintain the style of original google but it has no purpose (i.e no code is done for voice typing). 
* The user can launch the search by pressing the enterkey in keyboard or clicking the Rishab_Google Search button provided.
